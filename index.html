                    <h3 class="color">His Beginning:</h3>
                    <p>Musk was born June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Tranvsvaal, South Africa to his mother, a model from Regina, Canada, and his father Errol Musk, a South African-born mechanical engineer. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in locations in South Africa. At age 10, he discovered computing with the Commodore VIC-20. He taught himself computer programming and at age 12 sold the code for a BASIC-based video game he created called 'Blastar' for approximately $500 USD. After graduating from high school in Pretoria, he moved to Canada in June 1989 after obtaining Canadian citizenship through his Canadian-born mother.</p>

                    <p>At the age of 19, Musk was accepted into Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, but transferred in 1992 to the University of Pennsylvania, where at the age of 24 he recieved a B.Sci degree in Physics, then a B.Sci degree in Economics from the Wharton School. Don't worry, he wasn't a total nerd; he and a fellow Penn student Adeo Ressi rented a 10-bedroom frat house, which was used as an unofficial nightclub. In 1995, Musk moved to California to begin a PhD in applied physics at Standford University, but left after just two days to pursue his personal aspirations as an entrepreneur in the industries of space, renewable energy, and the Internet.</p>
